# âšª Welcome to Coordinape

With Coordinape, communities can manage grants, salaries, and projects so that everyone involved can participate in how to reward and incentivize each individual while leaving each other notes on how the contributions that were made.

Contributors transparently reward the value they see created in an organization. The reward-giving process is lean and allows anyone to quickly weight-in. No more cumbersome voting or black-box committees!\
