description: For token gating your Circles

# Guild

If you want your circle to be gated (either by tokens, NFT, Discord, Telegram or Twitter verification or whitelists) you can use our integration with Guild.xyz to make that happen.&#x20;

To do that click on the admin tab and then scroll to the integrations section and find Guild.xyz\
\
To add the integration check out the [Guild Docs here](https://docs.guild.xyz/guild) to set your Guild up, and then enter your Guild details here.&#x20;

This will enable verified members to join your circle with no extra work on your part.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
This does not prevent manually adding members or vouching unless you turn those settings off.

If this integration is disabled the users will still be a part of this Circle.&#x20;

(In a future build we will add the ability to check to ensure users still meet membership criteria)
{% endhint %}
