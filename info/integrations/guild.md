description: For token gating your Circles

# Guild

If you want your circle to be token, or NFT gated you can use our integration with Guild.xyz to make that happen. \
\
To add the integration check out the [Guild Docs here](https://docs.guild.xyz/guild) to set your Guild up, and then enter your Guild details here.&#x20;

This will enable member who hold the correct tokens or nft to join your circle with no extra work on your part.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
This does not prevent manually adding members or vouching unless you turn those settings off.

If this integration is disabled the users will still be a part of this Circle.&#x20;

(In a future build we will add the ability to check to ensure users still meet membership criteria)
{% endhint %}
