# Team Selection

## Picking Team Members

If your Circle has the **Select Teammates** option enabled, you will navigate to the **Select Team** page. This page allows you to maintain a smaller roster of team members collaborated with and desire to thank.

![On this page, you may select any number of contributors, sort, or search to find those you have interacted with the most.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (44).png>)

### **Your Roster**

After selecting your initial roster, you can return to the Edit Team page at any time, linked from the header menu, to edit your group.

Team members list the current number of GIVE you have allocated. In addition, you can see whom youâ€™ve already included in your allocation.

**Editing your list**

If you remove a contributor from your list after allocating GIVE, your GIVE will be returned to you (within the active Epoch).
