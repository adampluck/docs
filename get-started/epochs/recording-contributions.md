# üèÉ‚ôÇ Recording Contributions

### My Epoch

An Epoch is a period when your Circle members can record contributions, leave notes, and make [GIVE allocations](../give/). Circle admins create Epochs and vary in duration from 1 to 100 days.

### Your Contributions

At the beginning of each Epoch, your Circle will ask you to answer two questions, which will help your colleagues determine how to GIVE to you.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Epoch Statement" %}
Your statement is public for anyone in the Circle. In addition, the Epoch Statement details your work this month or clarifies the work that the DAO wants to compensate.

\
**Best Practices**\
It's best to summarize your work so that anyone from your team can understand what you did and its impact/goal. Quantify your work where ever possible for better understanding. Example Pushed 6 Github issues to allow us to unblock back-end work and resolve bugs impacting the use.

**Examples**

* Created the marketing plan for Coordinape, sent 6,000 tweets, and received 12,000 RTs
* Pushed 6 Github issues to allow us to unblock back-end work and resolve bugs impacting the user.
* Redesigned the landing page to guide users to the valuable part of our docs easier
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Opt-In / Opt-Out" %}
**Opt-Out**

If you _Opt-Out_, you are signaling that you have other income streams in your Circle which are sufficient for you, and you should not be compensated in Coordinape. **It will be impossible for others to give to you.**

**Opt-In**

If you _Opt-In_, you will be able to receive GIVE. You may use the Profile Statement to detail why.

**Settings**

You can change settings throughout the Epoch or future Epochs by accessing your profile on the Allocate Page to change them.&#x20;

For example, if you change your status to Opt-Out after receiving GIVE during an epoch, any GIVE you have accrued will return to its senders.

**Admin Override**

It is also possible that your circle admin may force you to opt-out if you are not eligible to receive GIVE.\
