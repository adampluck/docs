# üè† Organizations

An Organization houses all of your Circles in Coordinape. You set your organization during the Circle creation phase.

![Two Organizations with circles within them](<../../.gitbook/assets/Organization Overview.png>)

### Examples:

{% content-ref url="../get-started/new-coordinape-admins/setting-up-your-organization.md" %}
[setting-up-your-organization.md](../get-started/new-coordinape-admins/setting-up-your-organization.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Suppose you are a part of Acme DAO and have three teams within your organization. You might set up your Coordinape like this.

#### **Acme DAO \[Organization]**

* Design Team \[Circle]
* Dev Team \[Circle]
* Community \[Circle]
