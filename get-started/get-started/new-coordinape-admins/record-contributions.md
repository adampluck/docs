# Contributions and Epoch Statements

### Epoch Statements

Each Epoch will prompt users to enter their Epoch Statement, which should function as a summary of all the contributions that user made during the active epoch.&#x20;

### Contributions

During the Epoch your Circle Members will be able to add individual contributions that will reflect the various tasks they accomplished.&#x20;

(These contributions can also be populated via our [integrations](../../../info/integrations/ "mention") with web 3 work tracking tools like [dework.md](../../../info/integrations/dework.md "mention") and [wonderverse.md](../../../info/integrations/wonderverse.md "mention").)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Epoch Statement" %}
Your statement is public for anyone in the Circle and will show up on your card during the allocation phase for other users to view.

The Epoch Statement details the work you have done this month or clarifies work that the DAO wants to compensate.

\
**Best Practices**\
It's best to summarize your work so that anyone from your team can understand what you did and its impact/goal. Quantify your work where ever possible for better understanding.

\
**Examples**

* Created the marketing plan for Coordinape, sent 6,000 tweets, and received 12,000 RTs
* Pushed 6 Github issues to allow us to unblock back-end work and resolve bugs impacting the user.
* Redesigned the landing page to guide users to the valuable part of our docs easier
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Contributions" %}
Users can enter contributions to easily track all of their contributions to the team.

**Best Practice:**&#x20;

Enter a new contribution for the tasks that you complete, to add color to your epoch statement. The Epoch statement can function as a TLDR of all of your contributions.

**Examples**:

* Onboarding call with Bankless&#x20;
* Crafted Tweet thread for ETH Vaults
* Deployed Coordinape Vaults to new Chain

{% tab title="Opt-In / Opt-Out" %}
**Opt-Out**

If you _Opt-Out_, you are signaling that you have other income streams in your Circle sufficient for you, and Coordinape should not compensate your work. **It will be impossible for others to give to you.**

**Opt-In**

If you _Opt-In_, you will be able to receive GIVE. You may use the Profile Statement to detail why.

**Settings**

You can change settings throughout the Epoch or future Epochs by accessing your profile on the Allocate Page to change them. \\

For example, if you change your status to Opt-Out after receiving GIVE during an epoch, any GIVE you have accrued will return to its senders.

**Admin Override**

It is also possible that your circle admin may force you to opt-out if you are not eligible to receive GIVE.\
