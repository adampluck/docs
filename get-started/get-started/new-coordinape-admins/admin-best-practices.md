## Circle Size

We recommend Circles of at least **three members.** The closer the team members are, the more accurate the compensation process is.

**For larger organizations, we recommend creating more smaller circles.**

#### Things to consider:

> **Work Opaqueness:** The larger a Circle is, the less accurate your team member's assessment of each other may be. Members tend to be the MOST familiar with the teammates' work they interact with the most often.&#x20;

> **Various Areas of Expertise:** Members do not always have experience with the effort required of all disciplines within the organization. For example, A developer may not know the rigor required of a marketer managing an active campaign. Due to this lack of experience, they may tend to under allocate to members of the marketing team.

### Use Cases: Setting up your Structure

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Core + Community" %}
If you have community members that casually contribute to the DAO and a Core team you would like to incentivize, you could set it up like this.

**Acme DAO \[Organization]**

* Community Members \[Circle]
* Acme Core \[Circle]

The community Circle can input contributions and then GIVE each other kudos and tokens. Then, after the Epoch, you can compensate the community for their work.

The core Circle can write notes on current projects and give kudos to hard-working members after your DAO could provide bonuses based on GIVE tokens.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Working Teams" %}
We recommend discipline-based teams if you want to set up a few operational teams within the same organization.&#x20;

Teams should be **no more than ten members** for the most accurate allocations. Each circle should have a team lead with an admin role.

**Acme DAO \[Organization]**

* Acme Developers \[Circle]
* Acme Designers \[Circle]
* Acme Marketing \[Circle]
* Acme Community \[Circle]
* Acme Operations \[Circle]
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Projects" %}
If you want to use Coordinape to empower your community to allocate funds to projects, you can set your organization up like this.

**Acme DAO \[Organization]**

* Projects \[Circle]
  * Members
    * Admin Opt-Out of receiving but GIVES to encourage the team&#x20;

This structure allows your DAO to use conviction voting to determine how to allocate project funding.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% content-ref url="../../circles/" %}
[circles](../../circles/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### **How long should your Epoch be?**

The length you choose will depend on the projects your team is working on and how often you prefer to pay your team.

#### Things to consider:

> **Recency Bias:** Members tend to allocate based on their recent experiences. If your Epochs are too long, members may forget about work completed at the beginning of the Epoch.

> **Process Fatigue:** Every Epoch requires your team to record contributions and allocate to team members. If you have a large circle, a frequent allocation process could lead to burnout.

{% content-ref url="../../epochs/" %}
[epochs](../../epochs/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Your Contributions

At the beginning of each Epoch, your Circle will ask you to answer two questions, which will help your colleagues determine how to GIVE to you.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Epoch Statement" %}
Your statement is public for anyone in the Circle. In addition, the Epoch Statement details your work this month or clarifies the work that the DAO wants to compensate.

\
**Best Practices**\
It's best to summarize your work so that anyone from your team can understand what you did and its impact/goal. Quantify your work where ever possible for better understanding.&#x20;



**Example:** Pushed 6 Github issues to allow us to unblock back-end work and resolve bugs impacting the use.



**Examples**

* Created the marketing plan for Coordinape, sent 6,000 tweets, and received 12,000 RTs
* Pushed 6 Github issues to allow us to unblock back-end work and resolve bugs impacting the user.
* Redesigned the landing page to guide users to the valuable part of our docs easier
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

[recording-contributions.md](../../epochs/recording-contributions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}



## Ways to GIVE

The purpose of the Gift Circle is to reward all the ways value is brought to your DAO. Therefore, throughout the Epoch, each member should allocate their GIVE tokens to other members using whatever logic makes sense to them.&#x20;

Allocating GIVE should ensure that valuable contributions are recognized and compensated as accurately as possible. **Before starting an Epoch, you must guide your team on how best to allocate with the organization‚Äôs priorities in mind.**

### **GIVE Considerations**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Impact" %}
**Impact:** You can allocate to team members who deliver work that positively impacts the betterment of the organization
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Cooperation" %}
**Cooperation:** How often does this member show up? Members can allocate to others who show up often and provide valuable feedback.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Effort" %}
**Effort:** You may consider rewarding members who have taken many steps to complete a task or worked through unique challenges.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Passion" %}
**Passion:** Is this member aligned with the mission of the organization? You can consider the level of passion and enthusiasm a member brings to the organization.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Try not to allocate GIVEs based on who is ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to get them or member "hype." Instead, **GIVE** where you see value happen. GIVE to members that help you.

[give](../../give/)
{% endcontent-ref %}



## Setting Team Goals

The best practices for running Coordinape will vary from team to team. But, in general, we find that teams that **communicate** their goals for Coordinape to their contributors will have a better experience than teams that start Circles without communicating with their users.

So, when communicating to your teams, here are some things to make sure to mention:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="GIVE Eligibility  " %}
* Who should be eligible to send and receive GIVE?
* Should members compensated via grants or salaries be rewarded?
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Work Dates " %}
* Which dates should your contributors be thinking about when allocating?
* Should users consider all of the prior months when allocating?
* Should they only consider work that members completed?
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Contribution Impact" %}
* What type of activity would you like your contributors to be rewarding?
* Should a particular type of work be more valuable? (Devs or Business Development?)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Compensation Method" %}
* How are allocations paid out?
* Will they be paid in stable coins or project tokens, or is your DAO just tracking contributions until they have a token to distribute?
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
