# Add Team Members

Once you've started your Circle, two members will be You and Coordinape.&#x20;

### Coordinape in Your Circle

> At Coordinape we believe that we are building something that will help propel our industry forward in the way we think about compensation.
>
> In an effort to ensure as many DAOs as possible have access to Coordinape we have decided to forgo charging a fee to use Coordinape.
>
> We've opted instead to rely on the gifts of the DAO's we provide value to.
>
> The address associated with the Coordinape user is our donation address we can accept donations on EVM compatible chains.

### Adding Your Team to Coordinape

Before you start adding team members, you will need to gather their wallet addresses. We recommend putting them in a CSV or secured document, so you can copy and paste them into Coordinape. _In the future there will be more ways to upload your team but currently you'll need to do it one at a time.  you will be able to add members via our Discord Bo_

To add users to your Circle, Follow these steps:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Add Users (1).gif>)

1. Click Add Contributor
2.  Fill out the fields in the modal.

    Details on the settings are below ðŸ‘‡

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Are They Admin" %}
Circles can have multiple admins, but be careful because admins will have full access to your Circle settings.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Can Give" %}
* If Yes, the Contributor will be able to allocate GIVE
* If No, the contributor will not be able to allocate GIVE
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Forced Opted Out" %}
* If Yes, the contributor will not be able to receive GIVE and will not have the option to Opt-in without admin permission
* If No, the contributor will be able to receive GIVE
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Opted Out" %}
* If No, the contributor will be able to receive a GIVE after they Opt-in in their [Epoch settings](record-contributions.md)
* If Yes, the contributor will have Opted in and immediately be eligible to receive GIVE

_Leaving this toggle as NO prevents people from receiving GIVE allocations without logging into Coordinape to allocate to their peers. It may result in them getting fewer allocations if they wait until the end of the epoch to opt-in though_
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
