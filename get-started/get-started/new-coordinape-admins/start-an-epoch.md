# Start an Epoch

To start the [allocation process](../new-coordinape-members/allocate-give.md), you need to start an Epoch. Epochs allow you to choose a date range you would like your team to allocate during. Like traditional pay periods, members complete work within the Epoch time frame, submit contributions, then get paid after the Epoch ends.

> EG: Yearn Finance does one week long epochs at the end of each month where the allocations are meant to cover the entire months work.
>
> Some DAO's who have been in operation for a while and are wanting to "Catch up" on contributions may choose to do a short Epoch to allocate for all work done in prior periods

Best practice is to add all team members to the Circle before starting your Epoch, but new members can be added during an active epoch if someone was missed.

**Starting an Epoch:**

1. **Set Start Date.** Choose the date you want the Epoch to start.
2. **Choose Epoch Length.** How long do you want this work period to last?
3. **Epoch Start Time.** How soon do you want your team to add contributions & allocating? _(Time is in UTC)_
4. **Should this Epoch repeat?** Do you want the Epoch to restart automatically?
5. **Save.** Are you ready to start?!

### Edit Epoch

Once you save the Epoch, you will see the upcoming Epoch in the overview panel. You can edit Epochs before and after the start time. However, You cannot edit Epochs after they have ended.

### **How long should your Epoch be?**

What length you choose will depend on the type of projects your team is working on and how often you prefer to pay your team.

#### Things to consider:

> **Recency Bias:** Members tend to allocate based on their recent experiences. If your Epochs are too long, members may forget about work completed at the beginning of the Epoch.

> **Process Fatigue:** Every Epoch requires your team to record contributions and allocate them to team members. If you have a large circle, the frequent allocation could lead to burnout.
