# Creating A Circle

## What's A Circle?

A Circle is equal to a team. Teams of people will allow you to compensate members within your organization.

### Circle Size

Circles can have 1-200+ members in them. We recommend Circles of at least **three members.** The closer the team members are, the more accurate the compensation process is.

## Setting up your Circle

You can create a Circle from the Coordinape homepage.

Clicking on the **Start a Circle** button will take you to the screen where you can create your Circle.

You can also create a new Circle from the admin panel by clicking the Add Circle button

### Circle Information

Complete the form below to set up your organization. The Circle Admin can change these fields once the Circle is created, but only by the Circle admin.

### Form Information

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Username" %}
Your username will be how other users see your name in the Circle.&#x20;

_(If you are already in other Circles, please use the same name used in the other Circles.)_
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="ETH Address" %}
**ETH address:** Your wallet address derives from the wallet you connected to Coordinape



**Pro-tip**

_You can use your wallet for this since the funding will not need to happen from this wallet._
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Circle Name" %}
**Circle Name:** This will be the Circle name that your users will select.

For Example, if your DAO is **Acme DAO \[Organization]** and you have a core team.

Your Circle name could be **Acme Core.**

{% tab title="Organization Name" %}
**Organization Name:** This is the higher level of your Circle that will encompass all of the Circles within an organization.

The Organization name will need to be verified by the Coordinape Team to prevent spoofing from another Team.

**Acme DAO \[Organization]**

You might set up your Coordinape Circle like this.

* Design Team \[Circle]
* Dev Team \[Circle]
* Community \[Circle
