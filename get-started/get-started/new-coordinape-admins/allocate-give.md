# Allocate GIVE

### Showing Generosity

Coordinape empowers you to take part in decentralized payroll. Each GIVE token represents a percentage of your team's payroll budget.

Every Circle will likely have unique contribution guidelines; how you allocate in a dev Circle will differ from how you allocate in a marketing circle.

### Allocate GIVE

The Allocation Page allows you to appreciate the teammates you have selected by sending them GIVE and Notes. You can browse member Epoch Statements, and Contributions to help determine how much Give to allocate across your team.

### Appreciate Your Team

Allocate GIVE and type notes to send to contributors.

* Coordinape will reflect these allocations and notes in real-time.
* The recipients are the only ones who can see the allocated amounts and notes.
* You can adjust these gifts throughout the epoch.

It is advised not to allocate GIVEs based on appearance or equality. Instead, GIVE should be allocated according to the amount of value created by members.

### You can also see GIVE amount to allocate in the top left and GIVE received on the left hand side bar.
