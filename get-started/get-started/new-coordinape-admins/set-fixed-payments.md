# Set Fixed Payments

Compensation takes many forms in crypto, and with fixed payments, we've enabled the ability to compensate your contributors with a fixed amount.

These fixed payments can come from [vaults.md](../../organizations/vaults.md "mention") or can be a manually entered field if you don't pay your team with through Vaults.&#x20;

Fixed payment token can be set from the Admin tab, and can be a different token than the Gift Circle token (EG : You can run a gift Circle and have the results be paid out in your governance token, and then set a Fixed Payment of ETH or USDC)&#x20;
