# Your First Payment

One of the ways to pay your team is to download the CSV and use it to pay your contributors. You can find the Export CSV button on the Overview Page next to each Epoch. If you have a CoVault, you can submit a payment using the [Distribution Page](../../compensation/paying-your-team/distributions-and-payments/).
