# Get Paid

### Every[ Circle](../../circles/) may perform the distributions differently.

Some Circles may distribute on the mainnet, use L2s on a non-ETH L1, and use Coordinape ahead of a token and will just be tracking the allocations until there is a token to distribute.

For more information, see [paying-your-team](../../compensation/paying-your-team/ "mention")

![S/O to Zerion for the awesome transaction history!](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
### If your Circle is using CoVaults:
{% endhint %}

At the end of an [Epoch](../../epochs/), your Circle Admin will perform a distribution from the vault. Once this distribution is complete, you will see a claim allocations button next to your profile picture.&#x20;

\
There's no rush to claim, as you will have to claim multiple epochs at a time if you would rather wait. Plus, if your DAO is paying you in tokens that have [Yearn vaults](https://yearn.finance/vaults), any unclaimed tokens will remain in the vault earning yield until you claim!&#x20;

(Currently only available on Ethereum, but other L2's are on the roadmap!)

### How to Claim Payments

1. Navigate to the Claims page
2. Find the Organization you want to receive payment
3. Click “Claim”
4. Sign Transaction & Pay Gas

![Clicking on the Claim Allocations button will show your funds available to claim. ](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Claime Allocations.gif>)

### Circle Admin

Your Circle admin can tell you how and when the distributions will happen.

Until then, sit back and wait for your rewards to appear in your funds!
