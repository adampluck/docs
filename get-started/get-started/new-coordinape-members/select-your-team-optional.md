# Select Your Collaborators(Optional)

Circles sizes can range from 2-200+, but it's easier to allocate to smaller Circles(<20), so the users can interact with most of their Circle members. Smaller Circles also make giving/receiving tokens more fluid and more straightforward.

Circle selection influences the governance of allocations. For instance, if a group selects 80 members to allocate GIVE to, but each member is only working with 3-4 members, the circle may inadvertently become a "popularity contest" rather than allocation GIVE where value is being created.

You can help keep allocations happening where value is created by having your Circle select their Collaborators.

## Picking Collaborators

If your Circle has the **Select Teammates** option enabled, when you go to the Give tab you will see a Collaborators toggle at the top.&#x20;
