# Set Up Your Profile

## Circle Profile

Your profile is consistent between Circles; if someone shares a Circle with you, they can view:

* Your Circle membership
* Your recent Epoch statements
* Your biography
* Your skills tags & links.

**Note:** We recommend using the same name/PFP in Coordinape as the one used in the communication channel (e.g., Discord) to make it easier for members to recognize each other.
