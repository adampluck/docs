# Update Epoch Settings

### Admin Settings

Once you save the [Epoch](../epochs/), you will see the upcoming Epoch in the [Admin](./) panel. You can edit Epochs before and after the start time. However, You cannot edit Epochs after they have ended.

**Editing an Epoch:**

1. Find A Current or Upcoming Epoch on the Admin Page
2. Set Start Date. Change the date you want the Epoch to start.
3. Choose Epoch Length. Shorten or Lengthen the work period?
4. Epoch Start Time. Move up or push back the time? _Time is in UTC_
5. Should this Epoch repeat? Do you want the Epoch to restart automatically?
6. Save. Are you ready?!
