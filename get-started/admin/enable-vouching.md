# Enable Vouching

## Setting Up Vouching for your Circle

Vouching is the process of letting members of the Circle Nominate, and vouch for new contributors.

This feature must be enabled from the admin panel by clicking the settings button:

![Admin Panel](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

In the settings modal on the right side, the admin will have the options for the vouching settings, listed below:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1) (1).png>)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Enable Vouching" %}
Set to “**Yes**” if the admin wants to enable this feature.&#x20;

* The vouching process gives power to the community to add new members, as admins will no longer be the only users who can add members.

Set to "No" if you want admins to be the only ones with the ability to add new members
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Minimum Vouches" %}
In this box, the admin can choose how many vouches are needed for a new member to be added. The lower the number, the easier to enter the circle.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Length" %}
Number of days a nomination is valid.&#x20;

If there are not enough vouches, the nominee is not added, and the process will need to restart from the beginning.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Vouching Text" %}
Text box where the admin can set some guidelines for the contributors that want to vouch for someone else.&#x20;

* Example: “When vouching for someone, please send samples (or links) of the work done.”
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Only Givers can Vouch" %}
As the ability to send GIVE can be used as a filter or indication that this member has seniority, this option enables restricting vouches to just those who can give.   &#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
