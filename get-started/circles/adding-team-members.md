# Adding Team Members

To get your team started in Coordinape, you must add your member's wallet addresses to the circle.

### Adding Circle Member

In the Admin panel, click on "Add Contributor."

### Member Settings

You can edit the following attributes:

* Contributor Address and Name
* Starting Tokens
* Admin Permissions
* Allow to send and receive token

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Starting Tokens" %}
By default, all users start with 100 GIVE tokens; this can be adjusted **when there's no active Epoch** [(What's an Epoch?)](../get-started/new-coordinape-admins/start-an-epoch.md) The more tokens a member has, the greater the influence over the member's compensation. Consider lowering starting tokens for newer members or increasing tokens for trusted members.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Admin Permissions" %}
Circles can have multiple admins, but be careful because admins will have full access to your circle settings.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Can Give" %}
* Send Give means they can allocate to others in the Circle
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Forced Opted Out" %}
* Allow to Receive GIVE, this means they are eligible to receive GIVE from other users
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Step By Step

* Click Add Contributor - Admins may edit members by clicking the pencil next to their name.
* Enter Name & Wallet Address
* Edit Settings - You can enter their name, starting tokens, admin status, force opt-out, and whether or not they can send GIVE
* Save - Once saved, the member can start contributing & allocating once the Epoch begins.
