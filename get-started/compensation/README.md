# ðŸ’² Compensation

Coordinape allows you to decentralize payroll. Here's how:

First, members allocate "[GIVE](../give/)" tokens to each other during an [Epoch](../epochs/). These tokens represent a portion of the budget set for the team.

Then, after allocation, the Circle Admin exports a CSV and uses their preferred payment method to pay Circle members. If you have a CoVault in your organization, the Circle Admin submits payment for the team to claim.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="paying-your-team/" %}
[paying-your-team](paying-your-team/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

![CSV Output](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-05-17 at 12.55.42 PM.png>)

The compensation your Circle will distribute can vary from $0 to millions. The only limit is your treasury!
