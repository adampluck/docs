# üí≤ Paying Your Team

#### If you have a CoVault, you can submit a payment using the [Distribution Page](distributions-and-payments/). If not at the end of an Epoch, export a CSV of the epoch data for analysis and distribution.

![Admin Epoch History](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Export CSV.gif>)

### CSV

With CSV export from your Epoch, you can use this to integrate with your preferred payment method.

Since this is a CSV, you can use this file to pay your team however you'd like and on any chain you'd like; know that the addresses your contributors used to sign in are the ETH mainnet addresses.

#### CSV Templates

Then you'll need to take the address and the amount and paste it into the box below.

    * **`receiver`**: Ethereum address of transfer receiver.
    * **`amount`**: the amount of token to be transferred. This can be left blank for erc721 transfers.
    * **`id`**: The id of the collectible token (erc721 or erc1155) to transfer. This can be left blank for native and erc20 transfers.

    **Important: The CSV file has to use "," as a separator and the header row always has to be provided as the first row and include the described column names.**

### Step by Step Tutorial

#### Before Uploading

1. Download the raw data from Coordinape, and upload that into this Google Sheets template [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z4nDeBKj9Z81se3YIsiaY8JpbnVgz4vI78mUzeRgW6g/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Remove all of the contributors that received 0 GIVE.
3. Remove the ‚Äúsent‚Äù column, which is the column that outlines how much contributors gave to others.
4. Sum up the received column at the bottom
5. Add a column that says ‚Äú% of budget‚Äù
   1. Divide the amount received per contributor by the total sum to get the % of the budget that they‚Äôre going to receive.
   2. Add the total budget amount that you planned to pay for this circle/epoch at the bottom of the % of budget column.
6. Add another column that says total received based in USD
   1. Multiply the % of the budget by the total budget amount
   2. By doing this, you know the breakdown of how much the contributor should get paid.

#### If the user gets paid in one token, you can move forward with adding two more columns

1. **Amount denominated in \_(optional) We currently support 5 currencies: USD, CAD, EUR, GBP, AUD**\_
   1. This should only be for native token amounts. If you‚Äôre paying out in USDC, leave this form field blank.
2.  **Pay-out Token (Required)**

    1. The token you‚Äôre paying out in.

    [CSV Payments](https://www.notion.so/a361f457363a4a8fb8eb7a59bd5aaf93)
3. Upload the CSV in Utopia

#### IF the contributor gets paid in MULTIPLE tokens, then you‚Äôre going go to have to do the following:

1. Create 3 more columns for each token:
   1. Amount
   2. **Amount denominated in** _(optional) We currently support 5 currencies: USD, CAD, EUR, GBP, AUD_
   3. Pay-out Token
   4. Calculate the amounts accordingly.
      1. If you‚Äôre paying out in two tokens (assuming you‚Äôre paying an equal allocation of each token, divide the total received based in USD by 2
2. Create a new sheets, and copy paste the first table with only the first section of the first token into another sheet.
3. Then, paste the second token amounts UNDERNEATH the first token amount table.
   1. This means that you‚Äôre going to have duplicate contributors, wallets, etc.
   2. Again, paste as values only.
   3. In this case tho, if you‚Äôre paying out in native tokens, and denominating it based in USD, you would have to add ‚ÄúUSD‚Äù in the ‚Äú**Amount denominated in** _(optional) We currently support 5 currencies: USD, CAD, EUR, GBP, AUD‚Äù column._

Therefore, if you‚Äôre paying out an individual with multiple tokens, then each token requires a new row, meaning duplicate individuals.

Once you have this available, you‚Äôre ready to import into Utopia!

<summary>Parcel</summary>

With this integration, Parcel operators can now view the details of each Circle, the status of Epochs with the corresponding list of participants & allocated GIVE scores directly on Parcel. The budget determined by the operator is automatically distributed as per GIVE scores in a simple flow through Parcel saving them from costly errors & hours of admin work.

Coordinape integration can be found under the integrations tab on the navbar from the [Parcel site](https://app.parcel.money)

**Prerequisite :** Wallet address signed into Parcel should be an admin of the Coordinape Circle. If you don‚Äôt have a Coordinape Circle already, log in to Coordinape and [create a circle here](https://app.coordinape.com/new-circle).

Steps to follow :

**1. Go to Integrations tab. click on Coordinape**

****![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (2).png>)****

**2. Connect your Coordinape account**\
You will be asked to sign a message that gives us permissions to access your Coordinape data.

**Note:** We do not do any kind of write operations to your Coordinape circles. We use these permissions only to get the details of your circles and epochs.

**3. It will display all the circles on Coordinape associated with the connected wallet**![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (2).png>)

Click on any of the circles to view all the epochs of that circle.![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1).png>)

**Note:** You can only create payouts for completed epochs.

**4.  To view all the participants of the circle, click on** <mark style="color:blue;">**View Participants**</mark> **button in the top right corner to view all the participants of the circle.**![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (14) (2).png>)****

**5. Clicking on** <mark style="color:blue;">**Pay**</mark> **button of an epoch will open the review screen**. Enter the total budget amount for that epoch, and the app will automatically calculate the payout values to be sent to each recipient.![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (2).png>)

6\. Once the budget is set, select the **Payment Category** and enter the **Description** for your reference. Click on the <mark style="color:blue;">**Create Transaction**</mark> button to complete the process.
