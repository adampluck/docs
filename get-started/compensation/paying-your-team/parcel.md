# Parcel

With this integration, Parcel operators can now view the details of each Circle, the status of Epochs with the corresponding list of participants & allocated GIVE scores directly on Parcel. The budget determined by the operator is automatically distributed as per GIVE scores in a simple flow through Parcel saving them from costly errors & hours of admin work.

Coordinape integration can be found under the integrations tab on the navbar from the [Parcel site](https://app.parcel.money)
