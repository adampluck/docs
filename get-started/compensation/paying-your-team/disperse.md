# Disperse

## Disperse\*\*. app\*\*

After you have your CSV in the Disperse app, you can distribute the tokens you wish to allocate by pasting the token address into the token address section.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png>)

Then you'll need to take the address and the amount and paste it into the box below.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1).png>)

When you're done, make sure it looks ok, and then click approve and then disperse the token.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)
