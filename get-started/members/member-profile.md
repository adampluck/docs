# Member Profile

## Profile Name

Every address has a unique profile name on Coordinape. When you first connect a wallet, the app will ask you to choose a profile name.

This profile name must be unique across all of Coordinape. You will get an error if the profile name you enter is already taken.

#### Editing Profile Name

You can edit your profile name in your profile. Visit your [profile page](https://app.coordinape.com/profile/me), click "Edit Profile", then under "Profile Name" enter your new name.

Note: profile names are self-set by users, so you should not inherently trust the names. Only add people you trust to your circles.

## Circle Profile

Your profile is consistent between Circles; if someone shares a Circle with you, they can:

* View your profile
* Circles you're in
* Your recent epoch statements
* Read your bio
* Your skills tags & links.
