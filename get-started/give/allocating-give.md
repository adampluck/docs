# Allocating GIVE

### Showing Generosity

Coordinape empowers you to take part in decentralized payroll. Each GIVE token represents a percentage of your team's payroll budget.

Every Circle will likely have unique contribution guidelines; how you allocate in a dev circle will differ from how you allocate in a marketing circle.

### Appreciate Your Team

Allocate GIVE and send thank-you notes to your team members.

* Coordinape will reflect your allocations and notes in real-time.
* Only the member can see the allocation amounts and notes.
* You can adjust these gifts throughout the epoch.

### You can also see your unallocated GIVE amount in the top right and GIVE Received.
