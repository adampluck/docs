# Reviewing Distributions

Before distributing the funds to their contributors, the Admin's responsibility is to ensure that the allocations look appropriate. Some things to be on the lookout for are:

* Were any critical contributors missed in the allocations?
* Did any contributors receive an allocation that seems out of line? (high or low)
* Did everyone allocate who should have allocated?

#### After you've spot-checked the allocations in the CSV ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (31).png>)

#### or the admin panel if another epoch hasn't started yet, you can proceed with the distributions.
